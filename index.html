                <h2>
                Software Engineer seeking full-time opportunities for a development role.
                </h2>
                <h3>My strongest experience is in Javascript and Python. I am currently developing a project
                    with React which I enjoy. I hope to eventually get paid as an IOS developer but that should
                    take some time developing side projects with swift, which I have started doing. My professional
                    experience has been using JavaSript, VB.NET, and proprietary software including SalesForce Apex/
                    Java, among others. Utilizing AI tools is a great enhancer for me when working on projects.
                    I prefer a position where I can utilize this tool and also work on MacOS.
                    Current projects include a new portfolio site made heavily with React, a real estate management website,
                    a letter sending service, and what is essentially a dating app for dogs.
                    I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science, a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish, a college level minor
                    in Business, and a full stack engineer bootcamp experience.
